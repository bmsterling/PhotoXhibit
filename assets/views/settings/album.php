        There were grand ideas for the album when I first developed the plugin.
        But with the advent of Wordpress' much improved media manager, these plans
        are pointless.  If you were using the album feature, sorry for the inconvience.
        Please let me know at <a href="https://github.com/bmsterling/PhotoXhibit/issues">https://github.com/bmsterling/PhotoXhibit/issues</a>
        and I'll work on a script to transfer albums over to the new media manager flow.
