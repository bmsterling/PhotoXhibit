PhotoXhibit provides an interface to set up gallery widgets using Picasa / Flickr / SmugMug / Wordpress Uploads and jQuery

== Description ==

= note: = There are some admin styles issues that are being worked on and issues with the "Locally" option of the gallery that relate to Wordpress 2.5.  I hope to have these adjustments very soon.

PhotoXhibit, formally [Benjamin Sterling Galleries](http://benjaminsterling.com/benjaminsterlinggalleries/ "Benjamin Sterling Galleries"), was born out of the fires of so many not-so-great gallery/image manager plugins for WordPress.

This plugin uses photos from your Flickr, Picasa, and/or SmugMug accounts as well as allows you to upload and build Albums to help you build inviting Photo Galleries on and through out your site.

= Features: =

* Independent gallery creator for post, pages, and sidebar
* The ability to create a gallery based of some of the most popular JavaScript based gallery plugins
* Ability to customize each gallery's appearance with a styles editor
* Ability to grab your photos from Flickr, Picasa, and/or SmugMug
* An easy to use interface for adding photos directly to a post or page from Flickr and SmugMug (Picasa and Albums coming soon)
* Easily create and upload Albums with a single thumbnail or two different size thumbnails
* Easily turn features on and off via the options tab

= The following list of jQuery plugins are used in PhotoXhibit to help you build out your galleries: =

* [jqGalView](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalview-photo-gallery/ "Image/Photo Gallery Viewer using jQuery")
* [jqGalViewII](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalviewii-photo-gallery/ "jQuery: jqGalViewII (Photo Gallery)")
* [jqGalScroll](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalscroll-photo-gallery/ "jQuery: jqGalScroll 2.0 (Photo Gallery)")
